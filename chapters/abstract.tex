\paragraph{}The parameterization of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) solutions offers potential benefits for mobile robotics applications in a wide range of environments. Parameter optimisation algorithms for SLAM systems can be valuable tools for studying the influence of a SLAM system's parameters, as well as for trajectory optimization and error reduction in mobile robotics applications.

\paragraph{}This work consists of the implementation and evaluation of three parameter optimisation algorithms for SLAM systems: Grid Search, Random Search, and Simulated Annealing. The algorithms were selected considering the diversity of optimization methods studied and the time available for their implementation. The proposed algorithms can be used to optimize any available \ac{SLAM} solution; however, the experimental evaluation is conducted using Faster-LIO and Fast-LIVO2, two \ac{SLAM} solutions that are widely used within the research community.

\paragraph{}This document presents a review of the state of the art, identifying the main research gaps and providing a scientific contribution through the development of this work. The implemented algorithms were evaluated on two \ac{SLAM} solutions. The results demonstrate the potential of \textit{Simulated Annealing} when compared to the other implemented algorithms, achieving, in certain cases, a reduction of the trajectory error by more than half. Finally, suggestions for future improvements are presented.
