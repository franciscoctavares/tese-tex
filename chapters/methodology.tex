\paragraph{}This chapter will explain the methodology and requirements for the \ac{SLAM} tuning module, developed for \ac{RUSTLE}. For each implemented tuning technique, a high level overview of its architecture is provided. Test settings, including test algorithms and dataset choices, are also justified.

\section{\ac{RUSTLE}}

\paragraph{}\ac{RUSTLE} is a command line application, written in Rust, which facilitates the process of running localization experiments. On a high level, it allows to run different SLAM algorithms on different datasets, with user defined hyperparameters.
