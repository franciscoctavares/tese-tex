\paragraph{}This chapter goes over 2 examples of tuning 2 distinct \ac{SLAM} algorithms(faster-lio and fast-livo2), using all three tuning algorithms implemented. Given that the purpose of this dissertation is to optimize \ac{SLAM} solutions, there is not much sense in comparing the effectiveness of faster-lio and fast-livo2. So, it was decided to optimize each of these algorithms for a different metric, aligning the optimization goal with the algorithm's design goals. faster-lio was optimized for \ac{RPE}, while fast-livo2 was optimized for \ac{APE}.
